Description=Restart Tonics SystemD Service
After=network.target
# A Limit of 5 restart in a 10 second interval
StartLimitIntervalSec=10
StartLimitBurst=5

#
# Create a new file: sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/service_name-watcher.service
#
#  - Change service_name to the name of your website or any unique_service name
#  - Copy everything in this file and paste it in the opened file, remember to change the service_name
#  - Save The File
#  - Reload daemon: systemctl daemon-reload
#  - Start service: systemctl start service_name-watcher.service
#  - Enable service: systemctl enable service_name-watcher.service
#  - You can check the status if everything is fine: systemctl status service_name-watcher.service

#
#   If you have also created the watcher service and path, you can enable and start the two service like so:
#       systemctl enable service_name-watcher.{path,service}
#       systemctl start service_name-watcher.{path,service}
#
#       This way you do not have to enable the watcher service and the path, the above would do the two
