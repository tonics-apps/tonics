Tonics CMS is an open-source versatile and flexible content management system that is built with a highly modular, and adaptable architecture.

Its unique feature is its event-driven approach, where modules communicate with each other through events, making it easy to develop and customize websites.

## About Tonics

Tonics CMS is born out of frustration with the limitations of traditional CMS platforms that force users to work within a rigid framework, while most CMS platforms are pluggable to a certain extent, there is no option to unplug features of the Core CMS.

In Tonics, you only use what you need while ensuring your website is tailored to your specific requirements, at the heart of Tonics Core System is an event-driven architecture, modules or apps communicate with each other through events, making it easy to hook into events, this makes Tonics an ideal choice for developers who want to build custom websites quickly and efficiently.
